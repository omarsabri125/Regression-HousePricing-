# Model Training and Evaluation

This notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Selection**
4. **Splitting Data**
5. **Training Models**
6. **Model Evaluation**

## 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: 
Loading the dataset, checking for missing values, and preparing the data for modeling.
## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzing the data distribution and relationships between features using visualizations.
## 3. Feature Selection: 
Selecting relevant features for the models.
## 4. Splitting Data: 
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
## 5. Training Models:
Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
## 6. Model Evaluation: 
Evaluating the models using metrics such as R-squared on both training and testing sets.
